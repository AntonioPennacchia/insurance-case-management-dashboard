## 🧭 Interaction & UX Features

The dashboard includes several improvements to ensure smooth navigation and clarity:

### 🔹 Custom Navigation Buttons  
Enable fast movement between pages without using the default Power BI interface.

### 🔹 Information Panel (Info Button)  
A dedicated **info button** opens an overlay panel that dims the dashboard and shows contextual explanations.  
This helps the user understand metrics, filters, and visualizations without leaving the page.
