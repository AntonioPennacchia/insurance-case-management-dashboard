## 📊 Dashboard Overview

### **1. Backlog Monitoring**
The first page provides a weekly view of pending assignments, showing all cases opened before the start of each week and not yet closed by week-end.  
This helps identify workload trends, bottlenecks, and operational efficiency opportunities.

### **2. Case Details by Team and Employee**
The second page offers granular visibility over each insurance case — open or closed — categorized by team and individual employee.  
This enables performance tracking, workload balancing, and improved understanding of case processing flows.
